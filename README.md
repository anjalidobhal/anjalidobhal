I have provided proof of concept ensuring the feasibility of the proposed solution:
I have explored and tested different algorithms, including Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, and DecisionTreeRegressor.
I have evaluated the models using Mean Squared Error.
I have summarize and visualize data features:
I have used summary statistics and visualization techniques, such as box plots and histograms, to understand and summarize the data.
I have dealt with missing values and outliers, and you've applied imputation and cleaning techniques.
I have Format, clean, sample, scale, decompose, or aggregate data:
I have handled missing values by replacing '.' with NaN and converting columns to numeric.
I have performed data cleaning, including imputation and removing duplicates.
I have scaled features using StandardScaler.
I have Build and evaluate using different models
I have built multiple models, including Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, and DecisionTreeRegressor.
I used the code to demonstrate the process of loading data, preparing it for modeling, and evaluating a Stacking Regressor, considering issues related to non-numeric values and missing data. It's an example of a data preprocessing and machine learning workflow.
